# StudentManagementSystem
This C++ project implements a singly linked list to manage student records, including roll numbers, names, marks, and percentages. It provides functions for inserting, searching, updating, deleting, and displaying records. The `main` function offers a menu-driven interface for interacting with the linked list.
